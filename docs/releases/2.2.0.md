# Datafaker 2.2.0 (23 April 2024)

After reaching our 1000 star milestone, we figured it was time for another release, we lots of small and
bigger improvements. With a new Pronoun faker, language updates, and lots of smaller fixes under the hood,
we hope this release will fall in good hands and we'd love to hear what you use Datafaker for!
