# Datafaker 1.0.0 (3 Jan 2022)

The first 1.x release! This release is backwards incompatible with previous versions since while the structure
of the code is still the same, the package names have changed to `net.datafaker`. 

To migrate to this version of Datafaker, all you need to do is replace the imports from 
`com.github.javafaker` to `net.datafaker`. No other changes are needed.

## Notable changes

* Added ICD-10, ICD-10-AM, ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS support to Medical
* Added Appliance provider
* Added Breaking Bad provider
* Added Bossa Nova provider
* Added RuPaul's Drag Race provider
