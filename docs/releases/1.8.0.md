# Datafaker 1.8.0 (11 Feb 2023)

The first release of 2023 of Datafaker has been created. After one year of Datafaker, this marks
the release of the last version compatible with Java 1.8. After this, Datafaker 2.x will have Java 17
as a minimum baseline. 

Why 17, and not migrate from 8 to 11? Well, we think that Java 11 hardly has any benefits for Datafaker,
while Java 17 might have some more interesting features, such as records, compact number formatting,
and who knows, maybe some other features. Just to be clear: our 1.x branch will no longer be supported 
or maintained.
