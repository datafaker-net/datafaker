# Datafaker 2.3.0 (1 July 2024)

A new version of Datafaker has been released, which further enhances Datafaker. We've added new features,
such as an option to generate small images, added more locale data,  fixed some open issues, 
and added much more data to Datafaker. Also, lots of internal improvements have been done to make maintaining
Datafaker a bit easier.

The most notable contributions are done this release by Andrei Solntsev, who not only did his first contribution 
this release, but is now also a maintainer for Datafaker. Welcome to the team Andrei, your contribution is amazing!
