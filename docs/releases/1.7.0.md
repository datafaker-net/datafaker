# Datafaker 1.7.0 (27 Nov 2022)

One of the biggest releases has just been created, with the help of no less than 12(!) new contributors. 
Absolutely amazing, we couldn't have done it without you! 

Thanks to everyone involved, Datafaker now has more than a 100.000 monthly downloads, 
and is used by projects at Netflix, Alibaba, Bytedance and many others! It's great to see
that this library is being used, and again, thanks!

In this release, you'll find many new features, such as:

- 21 new providers
- Many performance improvements
- Far better SQL, XML, CSV and JSON generation
- Far better phone number generation. Almost all generated phone numbers are now valid numbers!
- Several bugfixes, mostly in the data generation.

Have fun with this release!
