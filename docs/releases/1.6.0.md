# Datafaker 1.6.0 (11 Sept 2020)

Another release of Datafaker. In this release, 'we', but mostly @panilya, have improved the generation of valid
phone numbers. While in older version of Datafaker every locale generates a phone number, more often than not
they're invalid. With this release, for many locales this issue has been fixed, so our thanks to @panilya for
addressing this!

Also @panilya fixed the documentation using a generator, so now [our list of providers](https://www.datafaker.net/documentation/providers/) is finally up to date! 

We've also received contributions from 5 new contributors! We appreciate all contributions, thank you all!
