# Datafaker 2.0.1 (18 June 2023)

## What's Changed

This is a bugfix release. It was no longer possible to specify the type of credit card and the type of compass due to 
a missing `public` keyword. Also, there was a small typo in the list of IATA airlines. Both items have been fixed now.

Thank you SaraMahdy for reporting this issue here https://github.com/datafaker-net/datafaker/issues/860
